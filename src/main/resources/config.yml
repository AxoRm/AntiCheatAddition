  # Here you can easily define your own simple Sentinel checks.
  # These checks are automatically generated, please make sure that you use NO SPECIAL CHARACTERS and NO DUPLICATE
  # NAMES to define a check (special characters are obviously fine as channel names and in "contains").
  #
  # Simple step-by-step manual to create your own check:
  # (1) Copy the section of PXMod
  # (2) Rename the section from PXMod to <NAME_OF_YOUR_CUSTOM_CHECK>
  # (3) Add the channels you want to listen to in incoming channels (e.g. minecraft:brand)
  #     AACAdditionPro will automatically try to generate the legacy channel name and listen for that as well (in this
  #     case MC|Brand). Generally, if you know the legacy name, add it as well and AACAdditionPro will automatically
  #     choose the correct one for your server version.
  # (4) If needed, define what the message need to contain to trigger the check. E.g. if you are listening to
  #     minecraft:brand and superspecialmod:version to detect a mod you could define containsAny as:
  #     containsAll: ["SSM", "ssm"]
  #     Note: that is a purely fictional example, the channels and messages will differ for each mod, and many mods
  #     will not send any message (especially if they are used to cheat).
  # (5) Define the commands you want to execute when the mod is detected. The commands are executed exactly once right
  #     after player join. This allows you to e.g. disallow a certain mod on your server by kicking players on join.
