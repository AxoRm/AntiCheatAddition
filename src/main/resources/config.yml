# This module uses advanced mathematics to determine if players can see each other.
# If the players cannot see each other several actions will be taken to hide information on packet-level.
# Due to abysmal performance of block lookups on newer minecraft versions 1.13+ ESP does no longer actually check the
# entire distance between two players. Instead it will use an heuristic to check the most relevant blocks. This can
# lead to players being shown even though they are not visible.
#
# MAIN FUNCTIONS:
# - Sneaking-Hider:  A sneaking player who cannot be directly seen by another player will be completely hidden from
#                    the second player. (This will make esp / tracers / radar / similar useless if the player who
#                    is supposed to be shown is sneaking)
#
# - Equipment-Hider: If a player cannot be directly seen by another player his equipment (hand, armour) will be hidden
#                    from the observer. (This will make the life of cheaters harder as they cannot properly estimate
#                    the combat strength of a player)
#                    This part will automatically disable itself on servers with MC versions below 1.11.

  # Here you can easily define your own simple Sentinel checks.
  # These checks are automatically generated, please make sure that you use NO SPECIAL CHARACTERS and NO DUPLICATE
  # NAMES to define a check (special characters are obviously fine as channel names and in "contains").
  #
  # Simple step-by-step manual to create your own check:
  # (1) Copy the section of PXMod
  # (2) Rename the section from PXMod to <NAME_OF_YOUR_CUSTOM_CHECK>
  # (3) Add the channels you want to listen to in incoming channels (e.g. minecraft:brand)
  #     AACAdditionPro will automatically try to generate the legacy channel name and listen for that as well (in this
  #     case MC|Brand). Generally, if you know the legacy name, add it as well and AACAdditionPro will automatically
  #     choose the correct one for your server version.
  # (4) If needed, define what the message need to contain to trigger the check. E.g. if you are listening to
  #     minecraft:brand and superspecialmod:version to detect a mod you could define containsAny as:
  #     containsAll: ["SSM", "ssm"]
  #     Note: that is a purely fictional example, the channels and messages will differ for each mod, and many mods
  #     will not send any message (especially if they are used to cheat).
  # (5) Define the commands you want to execute when the mod is detected. The commands are executed exactly once right
  #     after player join. This allows you to e.g. disallow a certain mod on your server by kicking players on join.

# If this option is active and AAC is installed AACAdditionPro will not execute any commands specified above and instead
# hooks the AAC feature system to allow you to specify punishments via the AAC config.
# This way, AACAdditionPro's checks will also appear in AAC's status messages.
#
# When a module does not have the key aac_score_multiplier, it behaves like an implicit
# aac_score_multiplier: 1.0
# You can use this to change the multiplier of checks.
